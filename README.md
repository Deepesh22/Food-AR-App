# Food-AR-App

- The idea behind the app is basically inspired from the problem of wastage or misleading quantity of food while we order it from some restuarant or from any food ordering service.

- While ordering the food we can't judge the quantity it will have, since the food menus are not interactive or we can say they are just plane with dishes names written.


- This app uses augmented reality to display 3d models of food. We can create the 3d models using various methods available, one of the most easiest and handy one like photogrammetry.
